<h1>Introduction</h1>
This is volume 3 of a set of volumes containing details of the Gumbleton one-name genealogical study carried out by Stephen West. Nearly all the Gumbleton one-name records are contained in a computer database from which the online gumbleton.com version is generated. These books are an attempt to make the same information available in paper form.<p>
Please note that this is not intended to be a narrative book that can be read from cover to cover. Rather, it is a compendium of records of the Gumbleton family, collected from a wide range of sources and associated, wherever possible, with particular individuals. Wherever such individuals are identified, they have been given a 'code' consisting of a letter and four numbers (eg N0004). These codes can be cross-referenced in a separate volume which list all the individuals.
<p>
Records in the current volume are broken down into twenty, or so, categories, as itemised in the contents list, above. Each item within the category is numbered, for ease of cross-referencing. Note, however, that the numbering is derived from internal numbering generated by the database software and does not always conform to the expectaions of human readers! For instance, numbers do not necessarily start with '1' and there may be gaps in the numbering. This is just a quirk of the database software and does not imply that any records are missing.
